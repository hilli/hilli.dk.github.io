					<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t help but look at the awesome pictures from EAB.
You also have some pictures of real old beauties like 
SR-71 Blackbird (The worlds fastest and highest flying aircraft...Or at least it was for a long time) 
U-2 Spyplane (Including pilot in spacesuit)
F-4 Phantom (also sometimes referred to as wild weasel depeding on armament)
This comment will probably move this page up on the CIA ranking :-)
Enjoy your trip
