					<description><![CDATA[Dan: Have you tried running fdisk on the device exported? It sounds like you are using a partition, and not a whole disk for the vblade.

moz: There are not any clients available for the Mac as far as I am aware of. Last I checked they had Linux support (as it was created there in the first place) and was working on windows support (Apparently some are stille using that..)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to follow your how to but have ran into an issue.  I have a linux 2.4x kernel running the vblade software and I have a 2.6.14.3 kernel with the module compiled in. I type in modprobe aoe and it works fine. This is the output from dmesg &#124; tail -n 3.
aoe: aoe_init: AoE v2.6-12 initialised
etherd/e1.0 unknown partion table
aoe: 001232f9c36f e1.0 v4000 has 70332570 sectors.
So I know it sees the drive but no device is locate at /dev/etherd/e1.0.  Any help would be greatley appriciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great HOW-TO! I followed it and it worked the first time. Did you write any init.d scripts to start/stop this upon booting/shutting down. If you did, you you mind sharing them. Or would you have any advise/tip about writing my own?
Thanks!
