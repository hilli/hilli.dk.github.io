										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I went with Brix to the place again, and we found the bike &#8211; 1,5 meters down the hill from the elevated road. A lot of pulling an pushing and some sweat later and we got the 200kg back on the road for some damage assesment before Falck (Road service) was there.</p>
<p>As far as I can judge it need to have replaced the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handlebars</li>
<li>Front suspension</li>
<li>Front wheel</li>
<li>Front fairing</li>
<li>Front break disc</li>
<li>Ignition (As its totally gone)</li>
<li>Holder for ignition</li>
<li>Lower body fairing</li>
<li>Some parts of the rear fairing</li>
<li>Travelbags holders</li>
<li>Parts of the electrical system</li>
<li>Bit of side fairing below the seat</li>
<li>Maybe exhaust too, but I could not judge if it was dirt or scratches on it</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some bastards have left the place, with my Fazer in the boot of their truck (Or so I think it went down).</p>
<p>The matter of fact is that it is gone without a trace. Arriving home from work wednesday, looking forward to a trip to Mols,  I found that the bike was no where near the place I had parked it the day before. I went around the block to have a look  at the places where I would otherwise park (In case that alzenheimers had kicked in) but it was not to be seen.  The restaurant below, where I parked in front of, told me that they had seen me park at the spot I expected, so  no alzenheimers for me (pew ;), but it also confirmed that it was stolen.<br />
I called the Police to check with them &#8211; They had nothing on it, so since it wasn&#8217;t them, I reported it stolen.  Got a reciept for that friday, so I called my insurance company to tell them. The woman in the other end came with  a slight <em>sigh</em> and said something about reporting motorcycles being stolen very popular at the time. That only  confirmed my theory about the heist. So I do not have any expectations of seeing that again, unfortunately. If I  had known it would have been a sentimental goodbye for the 30K+ KM we have had together over the last 3 years.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/640x426-IMG_1365.JPG" id="image74" alt="Fazer" height="404" width="607" /></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Last known good picture of the Fazer (10/7-2006)</em></p>
<p>Now it is only to wait and see&#8230; The police have a month to recover the bike again before the insurance  company has to pay up. Unfortunately there is a 20% self insurance on theft, so I hope that they pay good  bucks for it in the first place.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all bad though&#8230; I am now in the marked to get a new bike, and I have got my eyes set on a  <a href="http://www.bmw-motorrad.com/com/en/index_frameset.html?content=http://www.b%20mw-motorrad.com/com/en/products/enduro/r1200gsa/r1200gsa_main.html" title="BMW R 1200 GS Adventure" target="_blank">BMW R 1200 GS Adventure</a>. It is a bit of a different thing compared to the Fazer, but I have allways been fasinated by <strong>BIG</strong> Enduros and they don&#8217;t get any bigger than this.  1170cc flat twin boxer engine with lots of pull, 33 liters fuel tank, ABS.. The list goes on.</p>
